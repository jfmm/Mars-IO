#Mars-IO
Mars-IO is a Martian weather analyitics application which is under construction. 
The appliation uses data from the Open Source {MASS} API or Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System. 
The web app is not live yet, so this repository will serve as a way for me to develop and track changes as I build it.
