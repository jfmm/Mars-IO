#Mars-IO
Mars-IO is a Martian weather analyitics application that uses data from the Open Source {MASS} API or Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System (http://marsweather.ingenology.com/), and computes several SVG visualizations with D3.js to contextualize all the data sent by the Mars Curiosity rover.

The purpose of the project is to provide an educational resource on Martian Weather, its environment, and the Curiosity Rover Mission. By gathering both the latest, and archived data available, the application can visually represent the information sent, over a 2 and a half year period, by a robot that lives 140,000,000 (that's Million) miles away, in the sloping rocky hills of Gale Crater.
