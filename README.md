#Mars-IO
Mars-IO is a Martian weather analyitics application which is under construction. 
The application uses data from the Open Source {MASS} API or Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System (http://marsweather.ingenology.com/), and computes several SVG visualizations with D3.js to contextualize all the data sent by the Mars Curiosity rover.

The web app is not live yet, so this repository will serve as a way for me to develop and track changes as I build it.
